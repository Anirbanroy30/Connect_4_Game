# Connect_4_Game
#In that project, I have made my own Connect Four Game in Java.
#Connect Four is a popular two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. 
#The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The goal of the Connect Four game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of oneâ€™s own discs.
#Connect Four is a solved game.
#Thus, the first player can always win by playing the right moves.
